    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Jonathan Cooper! I'm a software engineer at NISC (National Information Solutions Cooperative). At NISC, I work on
      telecommunication solutions, specifically in provisioning. Outside of work, I'm developing projects relating
      to networks and operating systems. In my freetime, I enjoy hiking and drawing. If you're interested in connecting with me,
      reach out to me over on LinkedIn <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-sch-cooper"> here </a>.

     <h3> What I'm Working On </h3>
     <p>
      Currently I'm building out my personal website. I've wrapped up building out the NFL predictor project I've been working on, and am looking for
      additional projects to begin working on.
